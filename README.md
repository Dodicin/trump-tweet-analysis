# Brief

Donald Trump uses Twitter a lot. *A lot*. The President of the USA is very vocal of his likes and dislikes on the platform, specially when we're talking politics, making his account a good educational resource for data analytics, in particular, sentiment analysis. 

The repository contains the data analytics work we've conducted on his tweets from roughly the last year and a half to see if we could find any interesting facts about them.
